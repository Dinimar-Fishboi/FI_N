## Description

This App provides users context on the NBN infrastructure within their potential new home so that they are best equipped to deal with or avoid potential internet delays.

The NBN provides millions of homes a stable internet service within Australia – however based on the Telecom Industry Ombudsmen and SME advice, there can be significant delays or issues providing Internet service to consumers within their own time frame.

Having reliable Internet and landline services is crucial for those who are medically vulnerable or require services to work from home – this App provides questions and advice based on the address the User enters so that they can be given appropriate timeframes and make informed decisions about where they are moving to.
